				<h4>Atlantis Sand Fynbos</h4>

fynbos vegetation type that occurs to the north of Cape Town, in the
Western Cape, South Africa. It is listed as critically endangered as it
is home to a great many threatened Red List species.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="list-with-image">
				<h4>Boland Granite Fynbos</h4>
				<p>Boland Granite Fynbos is a vulnerable Fynbos
vegetation type that occurs in the Western Cape, South Africa.</p>
				<p>Located in the Boland region of the Western Cape, to
the north-east of the city of Cape Town, this fynbos has 23 known
endemic species that occur nowhere else. It is threatened due to
extensive farming and what is left is in danger from a range of invasive
alien trees (predominantly pines, wattles and hakeas). A tiny portion of
this ecosystem extends into the eastern suburbs of Cape Town, in the
mountains around Somerset West and Strand.</p>
